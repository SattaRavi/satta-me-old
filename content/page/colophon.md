This website is written using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and compiled into HTML using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The design is based on top of [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll ) adapted to [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo). [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) are also used.

Icons on the site are from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). Typography uses Open Sans
and Lora from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The profile image on the site is from Jan 2017, taken from my trusty [Nexus 6P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_6P) and was processed using [Prisma](https://prisma-ai.com/).

Lastly, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used to publish on [Github](https://github.com), where all the code for this website is freely available. Please feel free to contribute, via pull requests, issues, or any other way.
