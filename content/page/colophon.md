This website is written using vscode and compiled into HTML using Hugo - a static site generator written in Go. The design is based on top of the excellent work by Prakhar Srivastav using the minimalistic CSS framework called Skeleton.

Icons on the site are courtesy of Fontello. Typography uses Source Sans Pro and Open Sans.

The profile image on the homepage is from March 2017, and was taken in New Orleans. Credit for the photo goes to Vasuki.

Lastly, Git is used to publish on Github, where all the code for this website is freely available. Please feel free to contribute, via pull requests, issues, or any other way.
